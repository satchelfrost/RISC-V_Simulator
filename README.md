# RISC-V_Simulator

This project aims to create a RISC-V instruction set simulator (ISS).

### RV32I As described in the specification:

"Although it is convenient to speak of the RISC-V ISA, RISC-V is actually a family of related ISAs, of which there are currently four base ISAs. Each base integer instruction set is characterized by the width of the integer registers and the corresponding size of the address space and by the number of integer registers. There are two primary base integer variants, RV32I and RV64I ..."

### Current Progress:

As of now I am only attempting to implement RV32I. We will see what the future holds.

### To see some sample instructions that were loaded from memory and executed:
